# Comments at the start of the file are preserved
# when round-tripping files.
keys:
  zz: 1 # <--- Order of keys is preserved.
  yy: 2
  xx: 3
strings:
  a: "07" # <--- automatically quoted when it looks like an integer
  b: "08" # <--- quotes used consistently
  c: No quotes are needed when the value can only be a string.
nulls: ~  # <--- tilde
multiline-strings:
  short: |
    Multi-line text with short lines is
    dumped using the "literal" ("|"") block style,
    because wrapping isn't needed.
  long: >
    Text with very long lines automatically uses the folded (">") block style
    which wraps long lines automatically so the file fits nicely in a text editor.

    This is a standard YAML format, but you need rtyaml to automatically use it.
